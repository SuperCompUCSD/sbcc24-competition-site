## Software
We intend to use Rocky Linux 9.3 as the operating system, the GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C/C++ programs, Slurm for job scheduling, MPICH as our MPI implementation, OpenBLAS as our BLAS implementation, and Spack for package management.

## Team Details
Our team is comprised of six undergraduates that are members of the KU Supercomputing Club, three of which have competed in the 2023 Student Cluster Competition (denoted by \*). Below is the team roster with everyone's background and our intended strategy for each task.
