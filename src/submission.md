# General Submission Instructions

## Submission Location
We shall be sending out google drive links for corresponding teams to upload their files -- you might want to look at `rclone` to mount google drive onto your cluster

## Submissions 
Depending on timezones forward of Pacific Coast Time many of you will be either substantially into your setup day or just ahead of us. We would like to accept submissions for the benchmarks (should all be single text files) into the competition's google-drive location but we will only allow access each team's submission folder to members of that team. Please send email addresses that you want added to your teams submission folder. We'll be adding the mentor's to start with. 

**More application specific info will be released during competition Day 1.**

## Additional Info
For remote teams, We'd like for you also to submit files corresponding to the power consumption of your cluster for us to validate.
