# General Submission Instructions

## Submission Location
We shall be sending out Google Drive links for corresponding teams to upload their files -- you might want to look at `rclone` to mount Google Drive onto your cluster

## Submissions 
Depending on time zones forward of Pacific Coast Time many of you will be either substantially into your setup day or just ahead of us. We would like to accept submissions for the benchmarks (should all be single text files) into the competition's Google Drive location, but we will only allow access each team's submission folder to members of that team. Please send email addresses that you want added to your teams' submission folder. We'll be adding the mentor's to start with. 

Every team should have one they can access and *only* their teams.

<u>Submission Folder Names</u>

**University of Kansas:** KS

**University of Texas, Austin:** UT Austin

**Aalborg Universitet:** ASK

**University of California, San Diego:** UCSD

**More application specific info will be released during competition Day 1.**
