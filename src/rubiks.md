## Competition Input and Validation

For the Rubik's Cube application, you will be solving as many scrambles as you can from the input file attached during the competition. Please refer to the file `UCSD_SBCC_2024_Rubiks_Cube.pdf` distributed earlier for submission guidelines. It's been proven that the maximum number of steps needed to solve any Rubik's cube scramble, otherwise known as God's Number, is 20. Only solutions with 20 or fewer steps will be awarded points. Since each step is composed of a letter, denoting a face of the cube, and a number, denoting the number of turns of that face, each solution should have a maximum of 40 characters. [Here's your input, good luck!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DfUNbg_LxiPn3UQDxtFDh5zblKi-J7-g)
