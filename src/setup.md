# In person Teams
The complete duration of Thursday is for setting up your clusters.

You can speak to any outside sources and *real people* about the cluster and help up until *8am Friday*. 

You are *always open* to speak to other teams.

Setup instructions for onsite teams.

## Networking
For networking pick a port off the judge switch. An IP will be leased to you
from SDSC.  For NTP use the servers `ntp1.ucsc.edu` and `ntp01.nysernet.org`
synced to UTC time.

## Power
The power your cluster is pulling from will be on the PDU port closest to your cluster ports 1 or 6.

PDU info is behind our NAT and the IP to check PDU power usage is at <https://10.100.0.238>.

## Access

Note you will not have access to your clusters after 5:00pm so plan ahead before the end of each individual day.
