## General instructions 

Please put a video on display of your overall setup and a view of your power monitor. You will be trusted that you will not be accessing your cluster remotely, but leave the cameras on if you can.

For the Aalborg team: Please follow these times as close as possible in your respective time zone. You will be receiving the information on the mystery app as well.

## Application Announcements
For announcement of application specifications according to the [calendar](./sched.md) based on your local time zone. Please coordinate with Competition organizers.

## Networking
Networking is however you see fit. Simply sync with your local NTP server using UTC and make sure the power monitoring for your cluster is synced to the same one. For reference on the in-person teams are doing time sync to UTC based off `ntp1.ucsc.edu` and `ntp01.nysernet.org`

## Power
For power, since you are remote, we expect you to have a log of your power and during submissions include a full log of your cluster's power consumption throughout the competition -- synced to the same NTP server as your cluster. If you need acomidations please pm one of the organizers.

## Access
We're running on an honor code for remote teams to comply of not having access to their clusters after 5:00pm their time in fairness for the on-site teams.
